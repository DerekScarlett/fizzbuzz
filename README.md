# FizzBuzz
I took the popular javascript problem fizzbuzz and made it into a full stack web app !

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, node.js

What I wanted to do was when a user enters a number into the input box a fuction runs when you press submit that pins to the DOM whether your triggerd fizz, buzz, fizzbuzz, or error. when you get that number you have 4 buttons that when press explain why you got your specific result (fizzbuzz) . Then you can enter a new number and try again. I used the node.js to buid the server and host it.

Optimizations
If I had time to go back I would have a framework like express and mongodo to store the values and produce different answers based off different javascript function like where a number is a palindrome or not.

Lessons Learned:
I learn that you have to intall nmp before you run node and that you must create apath and endpoint in your server to use an image.
